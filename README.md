# Project 2: Virtual Memory
The program, implemented in C, creates and manages a virtual memory system using paging and segmentation. Basic implementations of physical
memory and translation allows for the retrieval and insertion of 32-bit addresses. A Translation Lookaside Buffer is included for the most
frequently visited addresses.
